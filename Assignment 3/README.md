This assignment deals with **Plotting and Visualization.**

It covers the following concepts : 
- Plotting data along with **errorbars.**
- Understanding **Linear Squares Curve fitting** and **Non-linear curve fitting**. 
- Performing **curve fit** using appropriate techniques for the dataset given. 

<br>

1. **Dataset 1 (Straight line)** - <br> This data corresponds to a straight line with noise added. Estimate the slope and intercept values. Plot the resulting line in a different colour over the noisy data to check the quality of the fit. Will you use lstsq or curve_fit for this?
<br>

2. **Dataset 2 (Fourier series)** - <br> This data corresponds to a sum of several sine waves that are harmonics of some fundamental frequency. You can either use curve_fit to estimate the frequency, or estimate it by examining the data carefully and making your own guesses. After that you need to estimate how many sine waves and what the coefficients are. Explain how you obtained the frequency and the amplitudes, whether linear or non-linear fitting is better, and any other relevant information.

3. **Dataset 3 (Planck's constant)** - <br> The data here corresponds to an observation of Blackbody radiation and follows Planck's law (look it up if you have forgotten the equation). You are told that Boltzmann's constant is 1.38e-23 and the speed of light is 3.0e8 (we assume you know the units). Estimate the temperature at which the observations were taken, and estimate Planck's constant from the data given. Briefly explain your approach.
<br>

4. **Dataset 4 (Unknown)** - <br> This is a dataset where there are multiple measurements for each point on the x-axis.You need to decide on what is the best fit, extract suitable fit parameters, and justify your choices.

The Dataset 4 contains random points on which we can do Gaussian distribution, and the final answer is just a straight line passing throught the averages. ðŸ˜…
