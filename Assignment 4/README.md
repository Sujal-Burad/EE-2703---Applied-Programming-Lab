This Assignment covers an important aspect of Electrical Engineering, **Solving Combinational Circuits.**
It consists of :
- Reading **netlist** files, and evaluating it.
- Doing **Circuit evaluation** by converting it to a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.
- Evaluating the states of all nets using **Topological Ordered Evaluation** and **Event driven evaluation**.

The zip file contains all the files in one place. <br>
Happy Solving! ðŸ™‚
