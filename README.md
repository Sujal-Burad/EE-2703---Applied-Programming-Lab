<br>

This is a basic **Python** programming course that is provided to 2nd year B. Tech students studying Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M). 

<br>

This course covered the Fundamental of python like:
- Its **datatypes**(int, float, string, ...)
- **List comprehension** and **decorators**
- **File handling**
- **Error handling** in python
- Using various libraries like numpy, math, and scipy.


The following is the overview of the concepts that I implemented in Python : 
- Solving a **(10 x 10) linear equation** using matrices and **Gaussian elimination**.
- Solving a given SPICE netlist using **Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)**. 
- Visualizing data using **Least Square Curve fitting**. Using **curve_fit** for non-linear curves. 
- Solving Combinational Circuits netlist using **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, and **Topological ordered evaluation** and **Event-driven evaluation**.
- **Animation** : **Morphing** a triangle to an octagon (or any sided polygon) and back to triangle, using mapping.  
- Finding the **Optimum point** of a single and multi-variable function using **Gradient descent** and **Simulated Annealing**. 
- Solving the **Travelling salesman problem** for 10 cities, and 100 cities using Simulated Annealing. 
- Using **Cython** to improve speed of solving SPICE netlist using MNA. 


The implementation of all the above concepts is covered in the 8 Assignements.
