<br>

This is a basic **Python** programming course that is provided to 2nd year B. Tech students studying Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M). 

<br>

This course covered the Fundamental of python like:
- Its datatypes(int, float, string, ...)
- List comprehension and decorators
- File handling
- Error handling in python


I also implemented the following concepts in Python:
- Solving a (10 x 10) linear equation using matrices and **Gaussian elimination**.
- Solving a given SPICE netlist using **Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)**. 
- Visualizing data using Least Square Curve fitting. Using **curve_fit** for non-linear curves. 
- Solving Combinational Circuits netlist using **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, and **Topological ordered evaluation** and **Event-driven evaluation**.
